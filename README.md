# Tealicious

A mod all about teas

## What does this mod do?

This mod adds a bunch of teas that cause many different effects.
These effects can affect the player, enemies, or even the world!

There are many teas with their own special flavors. Gain regeneration, flight, or even control the weather!

Be warned though, not all are safe. Our signature TNTea haunts friends and foes alike!

If you are ready to add new flavors to your Minecraft,
download this mod, jump in game, and brew to your hearts desire!


Installation information
=======

This template repository can be directly cloned to get you started with a new
mod. Simply create a new repository cloned from this one, by following the
instructions at [github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Once you have your clone, simply open the repository in the IDE of your choice. The usual recommendation for an IDE is either IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

> **Note**: For Eclipse, use tasks in `Launch Group` instead of ones founds in `Java Application`. A preparation task must run before launching the game. NeoGradle uses launch groups to do these subsequently.

If at any point you are missing libraries in your IDE, or you've run into problems you can
run `gradlew --refresh-dependencies` to refresh the local cache. `gradlew clean` to reset everything 
{this does not affect your code} and then start the process again.

Mapping Names:
============
By default, the MDK is configured to use the official mapping names from Mojang for methods and fields 
in the Minecraft codebase. These names are covered by a specific license. All modders should be aware of this
license. For the latest license text, refer to the mapping file itself, or the reference copy here:
https://github.com/NeoForged/NeoForm/blob/main/Mojang.md
